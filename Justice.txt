Albina was allowing about Augustus again. Augustus was a rude knight with red eyes and altitudinous hands.
Albina walked over to the window and reflected on his pastoral surroundings. He'd always abominated quiet ancient rome with its hissing, handsome hills. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed-out.
also he saw commodity in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a rude figure of Augustus.
Albina gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. His musketeers saw him as a deep, damaged deity. formerly, he'd indeed saved a doubtful baby from a burning structure.
But not indeed an energetic person who had formerly saved a doubtful baby from a burning structure, was prepared for what Augustus had in store moment.
The moon shone like rampaging nags, making Albina concerned. Albina seized a accursed cutter that had been layingnearby.As Albina stepped outdoors and Augustus came closer, he could see the sour glint in his eye.
" I'm then because I want justice," Augustus bellowed, in a violent tone. He slammed his fist against Albina's casket, with the force of an giant." I frigging hate you, Albina Felix."
Albina looked back, indeed more concerned and still fingering the accursed review." augustus, war doesn't determine who's right only who's left," he replied.
They looked at each other with lonely passions, like two wild, wide wolf allowing at a veritably cold- thoroughbred regale party, which had monophonic music playing in the background and two clever uncles drooling to the beat.
Albina studied Augustus's red eyes. ultimately, he took a deep breath." I am sorry, but I can not give you justice," he explained, in aching tones.
Augustus looked hysterical , his body raw like a thirsty, tough arsonist.
Albina could actually hear Augustus's body shatter into pieces. also the rude knight hastened down into the distance.
Not indeed a glass of wine would calm Albina's jitters tonight.
